<p> Participants aged 13 to 25 years old are invited to register via our <a href="https://vestatech.cybersecuritychallenge.lu"  target="_blank">dedicated web site</a>. Please note that a valid email will be required for the registration to be validated. Once registered, the participants will have access to a specific personal zone where they will be able to interract and play the game by initially submitting "flags", i.e. sets of characters that if valid will grant them points, i.e. VestaCoins.</p>
 <p>The challenge as such will be divided in 3 main chapters, running from december 2018 to May 2019. </p>
