The Cybersecurity Challenge Luxembourg is organized by C3, the Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg, within the frame of the [European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC)](https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/#ecsc){:target="_blank"} which is an initiative by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).
            
<p>This competition targets open-minded creative digital natives. Our aim is not only to find talents but encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity and related disciplines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through CSCL, we promote safe online behaviors by raising awareness on information security issues as well as develop expertise and interest in cybersecurity through challenging games and skill tests.</p>
