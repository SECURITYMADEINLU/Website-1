<p>This competition targets open-minded creative digital natives. Our aim is not only to find talents but encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity and related disciplines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through CSCL, we promote safe online behaviors by raising awareness on information security issues as well as develop expertise and interest in cybersecurity through challenging games and skill tests.</p>
